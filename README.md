# Sources-for-Spanish-Project
Source code for my sources page of my Spanish "Famous Hispanics" Project. Feel free to use it and change the links! I really don't care.

READ ME! VERY IMPORTANT!
I'm a kid that loves coding, and is still learning HTML and CSS. I will take requests to make websites, but nothing crazy, PLEASE. If you need something crazy, you don't have the right guy. I am 12 years old, I don't have copyright, I don't have nothing, alright? You don't need to ask me to use this code. I don't care. But, below are things you can/cannot do with this code.

THINGS YOU CAN DO WITH THE CODE!
- Use it as a base for your own site
- Edit the code
- Change the links and the text in info.html to make your own sources for your own project!
- Basically anything other than what you can't do (Except for stupid stuff like shaving a tree with it or something)
THINGS YOU CANNOT DO WITH THE CODE!
- Apply no changes to the code and then say it is.
- Bake a cake with it.

Happy coding!
