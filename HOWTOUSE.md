HOW TO USE THESE FILES!
Download these four files:
- index.html
- indexstyle.css
- info.html
- infostyle.css

Once you have these four files, open them in whatever HTML editor you use, you can even use notepad! (I actually use code.org, since it's very easy for me to use,
although you cannot import files, although you can make these files and then copy/paste the code into each [MAKE SURE THE NAMES ARE CORRECT!])

Once the files are imported, you may change the code in them. Read the readme.md to see what you can and can't do with my code.

If you just want to run them, put the 4 files in a folder, then you should be able to double-click "index.html" to open the site.

Happy coding!
